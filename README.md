The following is a description of the files within this resource:

**rainfall-bmkg.csv** CSV file containing monthly rainfall totals in mm from the "Umbu Mehang Kunda" Meteorology Station (station number 97340) in Waingapu, East Sumba, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia. Daily data can be downloaded as csv files one month at a time via the Indonesian Meterorology, Climatology and Geophysics body (BMKG) https://dataonline.bmkg.go.id/ 

**Haharu_district_boundary.zip** This zip file contains the .shp, .shx., .prj, .dbf, .cpg., and .fix files for the Haharu district boundary that was used for extracting district scale MODIS and Landsat 7 data in Google Earth Engine. We created the shapefileby manually drawing the polygon in Google Earth Engine, using the "draw a shape" tool, to exclude ocean from within the district boundary.
